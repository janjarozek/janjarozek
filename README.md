Welcome to my repository!
I'm a Junior Frontend Developer with still much to learn. As I progress with my knowledge at work I don't always have time for additional projects after hours, but I'll try to do as much as possible to evolve and bocome a better programmer. As time will pass I'll place all my work on this github.
